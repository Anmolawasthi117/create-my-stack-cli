## 🧪 How Redux Works Here

* All slices live inside `src/store/slices/`
* Main store is configured in `src/store/index.js`
* App is wrapped with `<Provider>` in `main.jsx`
* Example component `Counter.jsx` consumes the store using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`

## 🧼 Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server

```
